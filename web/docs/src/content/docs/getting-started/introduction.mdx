# Introduction to Strata

Strata is a statically-typed programming language that compiles to multiple targets: C, JavaScript, and bytecode. It's designed to be expressive, safe, and fast.

## What Makes Strata Different?

### Static Typing with Safety

Every variable has a type that's checked at compile time. This catches entire classes of bugs before your code runs:

```strata
let x: int = 42
let message: string = x  // Error at compile time!
```

### Clean, Expressive Syntax

Strata prioritizes clarity. Your code is readable and intent is explicit:

```strata
func greet(name: string) => string {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!"
}
```

### Multiple Compilation Targets

Compile the same code to different outputs:

```bash
strata --target c       # Optimized C code
strata --target js      # JavaScript
strata --target bytecode # Portable bytecode
```

## Core Language Features

  <Card title="Variables with Types">
    ```strata
    let x: int = 42           // Immutable
    var count: int = 0        // Mutable
    var count: int = count + 1
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Functions">
    ```strata
    func factorial(n: int) => int {
      var result: int = 1
      for (var i: int = 1; i <= n; var i: int = i + 1) {
        var result: int = result * i
      }
      return result
    }
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Control Flow">
    ```strata
    if (age >= 18) {
      io.print("Adult")
    }

    for (var i: int = 0; i < 10; var i: int = i + 1) {
      io.print(i)
    }
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Modules & Imports">
    ```strata
    import io from str
    import math from str
    import util from ./util

    io.print("Hello")
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Primitive Types

Strata has a simple, clear type system:

- **`int`** — 32-bit signed integer
- **`float`** — 64-bit floating-point number
- **`string`** — Text
- **`bool`** — `true` or `false`
- **`any`** — Universal type

## Design Philosophy

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Explicit Over Implicit">
    No hidden type conversions, implicit returns, or magic. You control everything.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Safety First">
    Static typing prevents entire categories of runtime errors. The compiler is your ally, not your adversary.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Performance Matters">
    Strata compiles to efficient C or optimized bytecode. You control performance without sacrificing expressiveness.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Simplicity">
    The language is minimal and focused. No unnecessary features. No bloat.
